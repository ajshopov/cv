        Originally working as an engineer in the mining industry, Iâ€™ve transitioned into web development through a mix of self-directed learning, a General Assembly bootcamp, and as a front-end developer at Adelphi Digital. My personal goal as a web developer is to combine my interests in productivity, data, and continuous learning to improve the delivery of information through great web interfaces.
